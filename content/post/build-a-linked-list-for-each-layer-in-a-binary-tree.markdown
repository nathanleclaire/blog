I've been going through problems in [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) to keep my chops strong and for giggles and this one took a little bit of wrangling for me to get:

> Given a binary search tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the 
nodes at each depth (i e , if you have a tree with depth D, youâ€™ll have D linked lists)

So a binary tree such as :

<pre>
       (1)
      /   \
     /     \
   (2)     (3)
  /  \     / \
(4)  (5) (6) (7)
</pre>

Will return linked lists:

<pre>
(1) => NULL
(2) => (3) => NULL
(4) => (5) => (6) => (7) => NULL
</pre>

I wrote up my solution to this in Python, and I'm going to share it with you to study and critique.

# Solution

## The Linked List Implementation

If you've ever seen or written a linked list implementation before, you'll probably realize there's nothing particularly brilliant or innovative about this one.  Just a good old-fashioned, simple singly linked list.

```python
class LinkedList:
    next = None
    val = None
 
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
 
    def add(self, val):
        if self.next == None:
            self.next = LinkedList(val)
        else:
            self.next.add(val)
 
    def __str__(self):
        return "({val}) ".format(val=self.val) + str(self.next)
```

Usage:

```python
ll = LinkedList(1)
ll.add(2)
ll.add(3)
```

## The Binary Tree Implementation

The binary tree implementation is similarly from scratch, and simlarly simple.

```python
class BinaryTree:
    val = None
    left = None
    right = None
    
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
 
    def __str__(self):
        return "<Binary Tree (val is {val}). \n\tleft is {left} \n\tright is {right}>".format(val=self.val, left=self.left, right=self.right)
```

No methods, I do all of the tree manipulation by hand.  This works okay for problems of this (considerably small) scale.

## The Algorithm

The algorithm that I came up with is actually slightly different than what is listed as the solution in the book, and depends a bit of idiosyncracies of Python that aren't in Java (which all of the solutions from the book are written in).  Namely, it uses optional arguments to avoid wrapper methods and it uses a dictionary instead of a `ArrayList<LinkedList<BinaryTree>>`.

I also differ from the solution in the book in that I grab the depth of the tree once and use that to determine the linked list's index, which is slightly less efficient than the solution that they provide.  If I'm not mistaken, however, the asymptotic complexity is still the same (`O(n)`).

My depth function is exactly what you'd expect (recursive):

```python
def depth(tree):
    if tree == None:
        return 0
    if tree.left == None and tree.right == None:
        return 1
    else:
        depthLeft = 1+depth(tree.left)
        depthRight = 1+depth(tree.right)
        if depthLeft > depthRight:
            return depthLeft
        else:
            return depthRight
```

My `tree_to_linked_lists` function does a [pre-order traversal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Pre-order), adding nodes to their corresponding linked list (based on depth) in the dictionary `lists` as the tree is traversed.  `lists` is passed into, and returned from (in its mutated state), each call to `tree_to_linked_lists`.

```python
def tree_to_linked_lists(tree, lists={}, d=None):
    if d == None:
        d = depth(tree)
    if lists.get(d) == None:
        lists[d] = LinkedList(tree.val)
    else:
        lists[d].add(tree.val)
        if d == 1:
            return lists
    if tree.left != None:
        lists = tree_to_linked_lists(tree.left, lists, d-1)
    if tree.right != None:
        lists = tree_to_linked_lists(tree.right, lists, d-1)
    return lists
```

This produces a result that is sort of in reverse order compared to the solution provided by the book, but it still satisfies the problem description to provide a collection of linked lists.

Alternatively, you can achieve a similar result, without using the depth function, like so:
```python
def tree_to_linked_lists(tree, lists={}, d=1):    
    if lists.get(d) == None:
        lists[d] = LinkedList([tree.value])
    else:
        lists[d].add(tree.value)   
        
    if tree.left != None:
        lists = tree_to_linked_lists(tree.left, lists, d+1)
    if tree.right != None:
        lists = tree_to_linked_lists(tree.right, lists, d+1)
    return lists
```

# Conclusion

You can find the entirety of the code [here](https://gist.github.com/nathanleclaire/9292861).

I need to be better at data structures and algorithms.  They are fun.

Until next time, stay sassy Internet.
